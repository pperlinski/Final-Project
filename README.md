# Final-Project
Final Project
## Machine learning 
The set up is based on creating a machine learning environment that will imitate a model that will perform a statistical algorithms, by inputing data into the machine learning environment to study patterns and make predictions by using mathematical representaion of the input data.
#### Supervised Learning- bese on labeled data, the data retrieved is clean and prepare for machine learning environment. import of dependencies are placed in the first cell of the machine learning notebook i.e import pandasas pd, from pathlib import pat, import matplotlib.pyplotas plt and from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
