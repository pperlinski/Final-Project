# Final-Project
## Group 4 Final Project


### Selected Topic

Our topic is an analysis of DUI and accident data.

### Reason why topic was selected 

Availibility of data, ease and high potential for interesting graphs and visualiziations, finding a common ground topic between CDC health data and consumer automotive data that we were interested in.

### Description of Data source

Raw data comes from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data tables. Data was downoladed for 50 states. A total of 150 .csv files were downladed and then combined into 3 .csv files using terminal and the following commnand "*.csv >combine.csv". The combined CSV files were then cleaned using excel, duplicate entries were removed from the cleaned files. 

[Performance_measure.csv](https://github.com/pperlinski/Final-Project/blob/main/Performance_measure.csv)
[STSI Combined.csv](https://github.com/pperlinski/Final-Project/blob/main/STSI%20Combined%20.csv)
[Table 1 Combined.csv](https://github.com/pperlinski/Final-Project/blob/main/Table%201%20Combined.csv)


### Questions we hope to answer

1. What state has the highest rate of DUI fatalities?
2. Are DUI fatalities increasing or decreasing? 
3. What states has the highest and lowest frequency of DUI fatalities?
4. Do DUI fatalities account for the majority of vehicle fatalities? 

### Machine learning

We will like to develop a model that predicts trends involving vehicle fatalities across all 50 states. 

### Database
SQL Postgres.
