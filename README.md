## Group 4 Final Project


### Selected Topic

### Reason why topic was selected 
Availibility of data, ease and high potential for interesting graphs and visualiziations, finding a common ground topic between CDC health data and consumer automotive data that we were interested in.

Raw data comes from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data tables. Data was downoladed for 50 states. A total of 150 .csv files were downladed and then combined into 3 .csv files using terminal and the following commnand "*.csv >combine.csv". The combined CSV files were then cleaned using excel, duplicate entries were removed from the cleaned files. 

### Questions we hope to answer
What states have the highest rates of DUI fatalities? Where are DUI incidents increasing or decreasing in frequency.
